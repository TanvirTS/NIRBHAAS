# 🌟 NIRBHAAS – Silent Expression Messenger

**NIRBHAAS** is a creative web application for *silent communication* — a unique platform where users express emotions visually and sonically instead of using words.

## 🧠 What Is NIRBHAAS?

Traditional messaging relies on text, but emotions often go beyond words.  
**NIRBHAAS** brings emotions to life using:

✔ **Color moods**  
✔ **Animated patterns**  
✔ **Motion dynamics**  
✔ **Expressive sounds**  

It transforms your emotional intent into an interactive portrayal — a new language of intuitive expression.
